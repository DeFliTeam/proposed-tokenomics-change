# Proposed-tokenomics-change

A Proposal to Change the Tokenomics of DeFli Network and Assoicated Tokens 

## The Current Tokenomics and Reward Structure 

The DeFli Network assigns an individual token to each project, namely baseDEFLI, baseDESKY, baseDACARS, bDecharge, DRODEC and DeLink. Each have their own reward tokenomics. 

The current token support structure is to assign real-world revenues against each project via "buy & burn". These revenues are determined by the revenues generated for each project 
element within our DeFli UTM. 

## Proposed Tokenomics 

To create a "master token" that can be acquired by exchanging the sub-tokens. 

The rate of exchange is determined by a "per-epoch" "network score". 

The network score is influenced by user revenue per token, network growth per token; weighted to include the difference in entry price points and staked tokens delgated to each network protocol. 

The master token will emit, per epoch, a fixed number of tokens. The allocation rate per network is determined by the network score or the current epoch. 

## Changes to Current Tokenomics of Sub-Networks 

None

## Bringing Revenues On Chain 

Through the current buy and burn methodology operating solely on the master-token. This supports the price of the master token whilst simultaneously increasing the value of the tokens emitted to each sub-network.

## Staking 

Staking of sub-network tokens in a "minimum lock-up period" protocol. The percentage of circulating supply that is staked is a determining factor in the network score. Staker earns "master token" as a reward.

## Network Score 

Determined by: 

70%- Network revenue in previous epoch (Nr)
10%- Device onboarding growth rate in previous epoch, weighted for onboarding costs (Do)
20%- Staked percentage (Sp) 

Network Score =  

(Nr * Do) * Sp

## Master Tokenomics 

Total Supply: 365,000,000  
Epoch's: 144 hours, reducing by 24 hours per 6 months to a final 24 hour epoch
86% Rewards | 7% Staking | 7% Team / Investors
